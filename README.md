Fighter Brief is a free-to-use drawing and animation tool designed to effectively illustrate procedures, maneuvers, tactics and troop movements in combat flight simulators. It could also be used for other types of milsim games.

Examples of usage scenarios include lectures, training, briefings, debriefings and collaborative tactics development.

## How to use

Select the object type you would like to place from the toolbar on the left. If the object is a moving unit type, such as an airplane, place it by pressing the left mouse button and drag it along the workspace surface. This will result in the unit moving along the path drawn. To see the animation, press the _Play_ button.

Note that mobile phones are currently __not__ supported.

### URL shortening

If you create a complex scenario, the URL gets very long. It is therefore recommended to use an URL shortening service.
