# Fighter Brief

Fighter Brief is a free-to-use drawing and animation tool designed to effectively illustrate procedures, maneuvers, tactics and troop movements in combat flight simulators. It could also be used for other types of milsim games.

Examples of usage scenarios include education, briefings, debriefings and collaborative tactics development.

## How to share a scenario

Once you have made a change to the current scenario, the URL will be updated. To share a scenario with someone else, simply send them the full URL. They will be able to see the animation, and continue editing it if they wish.

## URL shortening

If you create a complex scenario, the URL gets very long. It is therefore recommended to use an URL shortening service.
